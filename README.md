<h2>Task list created with vanilla JS</h2>

<p>I'm taking modern JS from the beginning course from Brad Traversy. This is the first project I made. Check out the course if you are interested in creating functional apps with no libraries or frameworks. Used materialize for CSS. Feel free to check out <a href="https://dorukozerr.github.io/TaskListJavaScript/#">site</a> and code<3</p>
